# protobuf
`protobuf` is an implementation of Google's Protocol Buffers in Lean 4, supporting `proto2`, `proto3`, and `edition`.

The goal of this package is to be the standard choice among all Lean 4 protobuf implementations. So far (1/7/2026), this packages has been fully featured in terms of **all core protobuf features** a user would expect.

# Usage

There are 5 methods to use this library:

1. Load a standalone .proto file.
2. Load a folder containing .proto files.
3. As a protoc plugin.
4. Use the internal notation.
5. Use the encoding/decoding utilities directly.

**The first 3 methods require the `protoc` command.
The last tested `protoc` version is `libprotoc 30.2`.**

Downstream users of this package can expect the first 3 methods to be always reliable and production ready. The first two methods are highly recommended for production use.

## Standalone .proto file

Say you have a file `proto/A.proto` relative to **package root**:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package test.a;

message A {
    optional int32 t = 1;
}

message Q {
    oneof q {
        A a = 1;
        Q b = 2;
    }
    map<int32, int32> s = 4;
}
```

In any Lean source file:

```lean
import Protobuf

open Protobuf Encoding Notation

#load_proto_file "proto/A.proto"

#check test.a.A.t

instance : Repr ByteArray where
  reprPrec x p := s!"{reprPrec x.data p}"

#eval test.a.Q.encode { q := test.a.Q.q_Type.a { t := some 1 } }
```

## A folder of .proto files

```lean
import Protobuf

open Protobuf Encoding Notation

#load_proto_dir "folder"
...
```

## As a protoc plugin

**Warning: Currently (v4.26.0) Lean 4 compiler does not prune the `meta` imports, causing executables to be exceedingly huge (180 MiB).**

First prepare a folder to contain the plugin, say `<plugin_folder>`.

```bash
clone https://github.com/Lean-zh/protobuf.git
cd protobuf
lake build Plugin
cp ./.lake/build/bin/protoc-gen-lean4 <plugin_folder>
```

Then create a Lean 4 project, with name `Foo`.

```bash
cd <root_of_Foo>
mkdir Foo/Proto
protoc --plugin=protoc-gen-lean4=<plugin_folder>/protoc-gen-lean4 --lean4_out=./Foo/Proto --lean4_opt=lean4_prefix=Foo.Proto -I <proto_files_search_path> <proto_file>
```

## Internal notation

**NOTE: the internal notation is protobuf-version-neutral, that is, you have to specify very specific behaviors of the encoding.**

One example is, in any lean source file:

```lean
import Protobuf

open Protobuf Encoding Notation

message A {
  repeated int32 a = 1 [packed = true];
}

#eval A.encode { a := #[1, 2, 3] }
```

With this you can define messages in a very convenient and compact way, and it does not require the `protoc` command to be present.

## Using encoding/decoding API
Please read the source code under the folder `Encoding` to learn their usage.

This usage is highly unrecommended and should only serve for debugging purposes.

# Missing features

Work in progress:

1. Reflection API: e.g. function `descriptor : MsgType -> Descriptor`. The option `no_standard_descriptor_accessor` is currently ignored.
2. Json mapping: designing, likely to be an add-on after we have reflection API.
3. Service/RPC: we will need to think through frameworking issues first. Currently services are ignored.

## Less likely to have
Some of them may never be supported:

### -Proto1 behaviors
`proto1` has been too old and is not worth an implementation.
For example, option `message_set_wire_format` is forbidden.


### -SGROUP/EGROUP in serialization 
The delimited serialization of message is not allowed, though they can be deserialized from wire format. The `edition` `features` enabling this are forbidden.

Note: It is indiscernible to an end user whether the wire format of a submessage is delimited or nested, since all protobuf implementations are expected to parse both, and so is this package.

Thus the absence of this feature does not affect protobuf functionality in an observable way.
### -Group fields
Only `proto2` allows group fields, for example:
```protobuf
repeated group Result = 1 { fields... }
```

This is forbidden. Use nested messages instead.

### -Options of extension fields
For example:
```protobuf
extend A {
  optional int32 a = 42 [default = 1];
}
```
The `default` option (and other options) of `extend`ed field `a` has no effects.
